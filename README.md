# PPD-ProjectFINAL
**This project is done for PPD module due in May 4, 2025 by 6 team members.**

This web-based application allows users to report obstacles on a map using OpenStreetMap (OSM). Users can create accounts, log in, and pin obstacles on the map with categorized markers. The system updates in real-time, ensuring that all users see newly reported obstacles instantly.

## FEATURES

- User Authentication: Users can sign up and log in to manage their reports.

- Interactive Map Interface: Users can click on the map to report obstacles.

- Real-Time Updates: Firebase ensures instant updates across all users.

- Color-Coded Markers: Different colors represent different types of obstacles (e.g., roadblocks, potholes, construction).

- Persistent Data Storage: Reports are securely stored in Firebase.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

**Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Backend**: Firebase (Realtime Database & Authentication)

**Mapping API**: OpenStreetMap (OSM)

**Hosting**: Firebase Hosting

## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS 
- User Profiles: Allow users to manage their reports.
- Reporting with Images: Users can upload pictures of obstacles.
- Admin Controls: Moderation of reported obstacles.
- Mobile App Integration: Better accessibility for users on the go.
- Alternative Routes Suggestion: Implement a feature that suggests alternative routes when an obstacle is reported.
- Use routing APIs (like OpenRouteService or GraphHopper) to provide detour recommendations.
- Help users navigate efficiently and avoid delays.
